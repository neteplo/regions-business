# regions-business
The goal of the project is to create a rating of regions according to the attractiveness of the business environment. A three-level expert assessment of the environment was chosen as the target variable. The functions were selected based on the literature on the topic. In the course of the work, several classifiers were installed, and the best one was selected in terms of the accuracy of the estimates. After that, the normalisation of  features were performed. Next, normalised values were corrected based on its importance according to classifier estimation.
